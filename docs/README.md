 #### - Main unit takes data from sensor unit through a Bluetooth connection
 #### - Then sends those data directly to the server
 #### - The server identifies the gesture based on the data received from main unit

 #### - After doing gesture recognition server informs the game application
 #### - When voice chat is used, server sends relevant data to main unit
 #### - In this project, we use the AWS GameLift service which supports multiplayer games
